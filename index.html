        <h1>introduction:</h1>
    <p>Enhypen is a seven member K-Pop boy group under the management of BELIFT LAB, a company under Hybe Corporation.
        The group was formed through the M-net survival show "I-land" in September 2020 and officially debuted on November 20, 2020 with their first album, Border: Day One.
        The seven members are Heeseung, Jungwon, Jay, Jake, Sunghoon, Sunoo, and Niki.
        Their name is inspired by the hyphen (-), a punctuation symbol that connects two words. Similarly, Enhypen is made up of seven men that come together and grow together.
         Their ultimate goal is to connect people all over the world with their music. Enhypen has over 8.6 million listeners on Spotify, with top listeners being from Indonesia, Malaysia, 
         Thailand, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, and the United States. Their music is a blend of pop, EDM, and rock, with lyrics about self-discovery, love, and connection. Their high-energy 
         choreography often incorporates hip-hop elements with focus on complimenting the lyrics of their songs. Enhypen’s diversity in concepts and their intricate storytelling sets them apart from other groups in the industry. 
         Thanks to their ingenuity, they have developed a massive international fanbase called “Engene.” They will be performing at Coachella 2025, an important milestone for the group.
